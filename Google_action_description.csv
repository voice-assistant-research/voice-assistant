94,Deako,"ABOUT THIS APP:
With the Deako Smart Lighting App for Google Assistant you can control your Deako Smart Switches, Dimmers, Scenes, and Zones with your voice.

OK Google, turn on the Kitchen lights
OK Google, turn off the Bedroom light
OK Google, dim the Dining Room lights
OK Google, dim the Dining Room lights to 25%
OK Google, brighten the Living Room lights
OK Google, brighten the Living Room lights to 75%

GETTING STARTED:

Before connecting Google Assistant be sure you've completed the setup of your Deako products. You must log into your Deako profile to use this skill.
Tip: Google will recognize the names you've assigned to devices in the Deako App so be sure to pick easy to remember names.
Once your account is linked, tell Google to sync your Deako Smart Lighting devices by saying ""OK Google, sync my devices"".  You can also use this command after renaming a switch in the Deako app or creating a zone or scene.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- Google Assistant can't find the device?     

If you recently changed the name of your device, scene, or zone in the Deako app, you will want to synchronize your devices with Google Assistant. Say ""OK Google, sync my devices"" to keep Google assistant up to date with your changes.

Google Assistant has trouble delineating between devices that start or even include the same name.  For example ""Kitchen Ceiling Light"" and ""Kitchen Sink Light"" both include ""Kitchen"" and ""Light"", Google Assistant is likely to have trouble.  Try keeping names unique, for example ""Kitchen"" and ""Sink"" will be more reliable.

The data is updated every minute but updated every 3 seconds on the main website. It's more up to date than any other source for this location, here is the list of commands.

You can say......
what's the temperature?
what's the humidity?
what's the dew point?
what's the barometer?
what's the wind speed?
what does it feel like?
How much rain today?
What's the UV?
What's the cloud conditions?
What's the fire index?
Is it raining?
What is the leaf wetness? (0 to 15, 15 being the wettest).
Tell me all conditions? (takes a second or 2 to load)
What's the summary for a brief 12 to 48hr summary (takes a second to load),
What's the forecast for the full month ahead, (takes a second to load)

You can try saying ""what is the..."" or ""Tell me the or just ""temperature"" or ""temp"" it may work 

Things to know:

The Beaufort scale is in with the wind speed and wind direction, asking for either will give the same results.
The feels like temp is in with the wind chill, asking for wind chill will give you the same results.
The fire index is in with the Chandler index, saying, asking for either will give you the same results. 
I am using the leaf wetness sensor as an instant rain sensor, it has a heater to dry much quick so the data knows much sooner that its stopped raining. With that in mind, asking if its raining would be better than asking for the leaf wetness, as the backgrounds are different.

If there is a condition not on here that you would like, please contact me at admin@brecklandweather.com

Thank you for using Breckland Weather, i hope like, if you do, please be sure to leave a 5-star review, it would be very much appreciated!

The preachings create a positive vibe and energy in people who listen to them, and encourage them to lead a better life and do good deeds.

Some feel good Buddhist preachings on the Speaking Buddha are:

¬∑       We ordinary people can see neither our own eyelashes, which are so close, nor the heavens in the distance. Likewise, we do not see that the Buddha exists in our own hearts.

¬∑       If the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands, pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of our minds.

¬∑       Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, no matter what happens. How could this be anything other than the boundless joy of the Law?

¬∑       Your practice of the Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life. If you seek enlightenment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and ten thousand good deeds will be in vain.

¬∑       Just as cherry, plum, peach and damson blossoms all possess their own unique qualities, each person is unique. We cannot become someone else. The important thing is that we live true to ourselves and cause the great flower of our lives to blossom.

¬∑       Before comparing yourself with others, win the battle with yourself. Strive to be better today than yesterday, and better tomorrow than today.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/12HDDfQl6OhjvLDmbaR-H9Q-FNwHLAOm-xczdtdZwmAs/edit

2051,Sous Chef,"This assistant is for the modern home cook who uses their phone as their primary recipe source.  The problem with using your phone as a cook book is that you constantly have to use your hands to turn it on.  This usually involves having to wash and dry your hands, then you have to enter your password because your fingerprint reader doesn't work with damp digits.  It's a huge pain, but no more!

Now you can access your recipes with simple spoken commands.  Simply use the Sous Chef Recipes App available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play to enter your recipes.  Then use your Google Assistant device to interact with your recipes in a natural way.  First start up the assistant.

‚ÄúOk, Google, talk to Sous Chef.‚Äù

Once you've linked your email address to the app and this assistant the first thing you'll want to do is add a recipe.  The app allows you to easily load recipes from the most popular food websites.  Note some websites may require their own login.  You can also load recipes from smaller websites like blogs or enter your own recipes manually as well.

Once you've added a recipe you'll need to go shopping.  The companion app has a built in shopping list which allows you to select the ingredients you'll need for each recipe.  You can type in other shopping items as well or you can add them with your Google Assistant device:

‚ÄúAdd sour cream to my shopping list.‚Äù

When you're ready to begin making your recipe you'll want to open it first.  You can do this in the app or you can simply ask your assistant to do it for you:

""Open the burger sauce recipe.""

Hint: Sous is a French word that sounds like the English name Sue.

You can also check which recipe you have open.

‚ÄúWhat my current recipe is.‚Äù

Once your recipe is open you'll be able to interact with the ingredients.  Here are some examples of things you can say:

‚ÄúList ingredients.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much baking powder?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many potatoes?‚Äù

Hint: if your assistant doesn't find what you're looking for but you know it's there use the app to simplify the text.  For example you might change ‚Äú¬º cup (4 oz) unsalted butter melted and cooled‚Äù to ‚Äú4 ounces unsalted butter‚Äù.

Next you'll want to go through the steps of the recipe.  For example you can use the following commands:

‚ÄúGo to the first step.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to the next step.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to the fourth step.‚Äù

‚ÄúRepeat step.‚Äù

Recipes in the Sous Chef App also have a description and notes.  You can access these by asking your assistant to read them aloud:

‚ÄúRead the description.‚Äù

‚ÄúRead notes.‚Äù

Hint: Sous Chef will get better at recognizing your recipes over time.  The more recipes that are added the more text we'll have to analyze to improve our speech recognition models.

That's all there is to it, hands free recipe access at your command.  It's like having your own personal assistant in the kitchen.  With all of Google Assistants other great cooking features like timers and measurement conversions you'll be cooking with ease in no time.

If you have any questions, comments or ideas about new features, please don't hesitate to contact us via the app or by emailing help@souschef.recipes.  Also be sure to check out the helpful ‚ÄúHow To‚Äù videos available in the app or by visiting http://souschef.recipes.

2239,Remootio Smart Controller,"Using this action the Google Assistant will be able to communicate with your Remootio devices, so you will be able to ask the Assistant to close or open your gates and garage doors for you. You will also be able to check if they are closed or not.

Remootio is a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled end-to-end encrypted smart remote controller that lets you control your gates and garage doors using your smartphone. 
For more information visit www.remootio.com

You must have a Remootio device installed and set up in order to use this action. 
You also need to have the following settings:
- The Remootio device has to be connected to the internet using EasyConnect (you can set this up in the Remootio smartphone app)
- The status sensor add-on has to be installed, and enabled in the smartphone app.
- You need to share a key with the Google Assistant, so she can communicate with your device for you. This is done by linking your device to your Remootio account in the smartphone app. When you do this a key called Smart home will appear in your shared key list. You can give or revoke internet access to this key just as you would do for any other key. If the access right is revoked, Google Home will not be able to control your device. To unlink your device from the Remootio account, simply delete the Smart home key, just as you would delete any other regular key.
- If you don't have a Remootio account yet, you can register one for free in the smartphone app.
- Opening the gate or garage door by voice requires a security PIN code. You can set this pin code in the app under the Remootio account settings menu.

After the steps above are all set up, and the internet access for the Smart home key is enabled, you can ask the Assistant to close the gate or garage door for you by saying: ""Ok Google, close the garage door"" (substitute garage door with the name of your device in the Remootio app)

You can also check whether it is open or closed by saying: ""Ok Google, is the garage door closed?"" (substitute garage door with the name of your device in the Remootio app)

You can also open your gate or garage door by saying ""Ok Google, open the garage door"" (substitute garage door with the name of your device in the Remootio app).",https://www.remootio.com/privacypolicy_remootiosmartcontroller.html

"" WHAT SHOULD I ORDER TODAY""
by asking this question you can solve a question which is ""what shall i order""
Pizza (Italian: [Ààpittsa], Neapolitan: [Ààpitts…ô]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.

In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced and eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.[5][6] Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.

The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.[7] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish,[8][9] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[10]",https://sites.google.com/view/myfavouritepizza/home
