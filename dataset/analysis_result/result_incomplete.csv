1,Call Handler,[ Your email address used.],"Call Handler rejects unwanted phone calls for you.  It also play 'on hold' music - just like an expensive phone system, allowing you to step away from calls to find a pen and paper (or just make coffee!).

REJECTING UNWANTED CALLS

Once you've identified a call as unwanted, simply cover the mouthpiece and say to Alexa:

""Alexa, open Call Handler""
""Alexa, ask Call Handler to take this""
""Alexa, ask Call Handler to reject this call""

Then place your phone down beside your Alexa device and she'll take it from there.

Alexa will happily take on the role of your personal assistant.  She will politely - but firmly - reject the call.   She sometimes plays some hold music as well.  Finally, she will play a 'disconnected call' tone and make an additional announcements for very persistent callers.

You're welcome to stay and listen, or just walk away and make coffee.  

But don't forget that Alexa has no fingers, so she can't hang up your phone for you - remember to come back and do that after a minute or two.

PLAYING ON-HOLD MUSIC:

Call Handler can also play music while you put your caller on hold, just like a professional phone system.  So if you need to step away but plan to return to your call, you can say:

""Alexa, ask Call Handler to play hold music""

If you don't like the first track, you can interrupt and say ""Alexa, play something else"".  If you hear one you do like, you can save it as the default track by saying ""Alexa, remember this song"".   The music tracks vary in length from 1-3 minutes, hopefully giving you just enough time to do what you need to before continuing the call.  At the end of a track, Alexa will whisper a prompt,  asking if you want more music. She whispers because your caller may be listening.  Don't forget to pick up your call again!

STANDBY MODE

You can say ""Alexa, ask Call Handler to stay quiet"" to start the skill without prompts.  It will play a low beep every ten seconds.  Interrupt it by saying ""Alexa, take this call"".   If you have an Echo Show or Spot, you can touch a button instead.

ONE-SHOT INVOCATIONS

You can ask Call Hander to just get started, without prompting by saying:

""Alexa, ask Call Handler to get rid of this caller""
""Alexa, ask Call Handler to play hold music""
""Alexa, tell Call Handler to disconnect""

DISPLAY DEVICES

- On  display devices like Echo Show and Spot, there are quick-access buttons for reject call, play hold music, help and stop.
- While playing a call rejection message, tapping the button again chooses another message.
- While playing hold music, tapping the button again selects another track at random.
- While playing hold music, you can say ""Alexa, remember this track"", to save the current track as the default.
- You can say Change voice to Brian, Amy, Matthew or Alexa, to save that voice as the default.
- Say ""Alexa, clear settings"" to clear your saved music track and voice.

USER GUIDE

Call Handler can email you its new User Guide to help you get even more out of this skill.  The guide describes everything you can say to Call Handler in a bit more depth than the Help command.
To request it, just say ""send me the user guide"" at any prompt.
In order to send the email, Call Handler needs permission to access your email address and first name.  Your email address is used to deliver the User Guide.  Your name is used to personalise the message (""Dear Alex"", not ""Dear Customer""). This helps you and your email software to distinguish legitimate messages from spam.
The first time you request the User Guide, the skill will ask you to grant these two permissions using the Home screen in your Alexa app.
Once you have granted both permissions, just re-open the skill and ask for the User Guide again.

# privacy policy/terms of use

点击数：127 2017年07月21日 来源：

Welcome! So you have purchased our Secrui device and are starting to use the
devices! Any information you share with us (e.g. for creating a Secrui
Account) will help us to provide you with services related to Secrui device
and to improve them to make them even better. We explain here our ways of
collecting and using information, and how we protect your privacy. In this

personal and non-personal data to enable and facilitate the best user

2,Bike Share,[Bike Share ask for your street name.],"NOTE: Bike Share only currently supports Citibike in New York City. Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""
Alexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. 

If you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: ""change my address"". Alexa will ask if you want to overwrite your current address; if you respond ""yes"", you will be given the chance to enter a new address.","

# Privacy Policy

As a fellow Internet user myself, I totally respect your online privacy. So it
goes without saying that I’m fully committed to safeguarding your online
privacy while you’re here at http://DougDevitre.com.

And that’s precisely why I’ve decided to include the following, which
discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this
website.

**Log Files**

Like most standard websites, this website uses log files. These include:
Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses), browser type, Internet Service
Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and the
number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement
in the aggregate, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate
use. IP addresses, etc., are not linked to personally identifiable
information.

**Web Cookies and Beacons**

Web cookies (also known as HTTP cookies, or just cookies) are parcels of text
that are sent by a server to a Web browser, and then sent back unchanged by
the browser each time it accesses that server. In other words, a cookie is a
piece of data stored on a user’s computer that is tied to information about
the user.

Web beacons are objects that are embedded in a webpage or email that are
invisible to the user, but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or
email. Other names are web bug, tracking bug, tag or page tag.

This website does use cookies. Additionally, some of my business partners may
use cookies and web beacons as well. This site has no access to, or control of
advertisers’ web cookies or web beacons.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser
options. Please check your browser’s help section for instructions on how to
do this.

**Links**

This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that I am not
responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. I encourage you, when
you leave this website, to read the privacy policy (or privacy statement) of
each and every website you visit, as this particular privacy policy applies
solely to this particular website.

**Advertisers**

I use outside advertising networks and companies in order to display ads on
this site. These ads may contain cookies and/or web beacons in order to
collect data in the ad serving process. These such cookies and/or web beacons
are collected by the companies and/or advertising networks, themselves. I do
not have any access to this information.

I currently work with several advertising networks and companies. If you have
any questions, please check their websites for their respective privacy
policies.

**Webmaster Contact Information**

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding http://DougDevitre.com
privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at support @ Doug Devitre.com.

1,Best Roomies,"[The skill requires access to your name., The skill requires access to name email.]","Taking out your mobile device just to add a few bucks is sometimes an overkill.
Expenses apps cost a lot of money and sometimes some of the roommates devices are not supported.

Best Roomies is a simple yet effective skill to help you get your expenses split fairly among roommates.

In order to add new payments, you must be part of an household, so if you are the first roommate in your household to use the skill, first say:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to create a new household""

Once the household is created, you can add new payments by saying, for example:
""Alexa, tell Best Roomies I paid 20 dollars for groceries"".
If you did a mistake, you can undo the last payments by saying:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to undo""

If you want to know the amount you paid you can say:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies how much I paid this month"" or ""Alexa, ask Best Roomies how much I paid in April"". or ""Alexa, ask Best Roomies for my monthly summary"".

To get the household summary, just ask:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies for household monthly summary"" or ""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to get household summary for March"".

If you want to get a detailed report of your payments, you can ask, for example:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to send my monthly summary"" or ""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to send me my payments for May"".
If you want to get the payments made by all the roommates, ask for example:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to send me the household monthly summary"" or ""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to send me the household payments for March"".
Notice: asking the skill to send you the payments report will ask you to give the skill Account Linking permission in order to get your email address.
No usage other then sending the report will be used and the data will not be stored anywhere.

If you are moving out, you can ask Alexa to leave the household:
""Alexa, ask Best Roomies to leave the household"". 
Notice this will delete all your payments, so be sure to settle them first ;)

The skill requires access to your name and email. 
Both will be used for your summary reports ONLY (upon request).","

### This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for:

  
Best Roomies Skill
